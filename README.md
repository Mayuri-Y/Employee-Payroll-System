# Employee-Payroll-System
 Employee Payroll System in Java. Note that this is a console-based application, and in a real-world scenario, 
 you would likely implement a web-based interface, integrate with a database, and include additional features for user authentication and secure payroll processing.
 This example provides a basic structure for an Employee Payroll System. In a real-world scenario, you would implement a web-based interface, 
 integrate with a database for persistent storage, and include additional features for user authentication and secure payroll processing. 
 Also, the tax calculation is simplified here, and you may need to implement a more sophisticated tax calculation method based on your specific requirements and regulations.
